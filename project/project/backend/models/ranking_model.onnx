# This is a placeholder for the ONNX ranking model
# In production, this would be a trained LightGBM model exported to ONNX
#
# Training process (to be done separately in Python):
# 1. Collect features: skill_overlap, location_distance, sector_match, diversity_score, etc.
# 2. Train LightGBM learning-to-rank model on historical match quality data
# 3. Export to ONNX using onnxmltools
# 4. Place the .onnx file in this location
#
# Model specifications:
# - Input: Feature vector [6 features]
# - Output: Match score (0-100)
# - Optimized for ranking internship matches
