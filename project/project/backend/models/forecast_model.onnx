# This is a placeholder for the ONNX forecasting model
# In production, this would be a trained LSTM model for demand prediction
#
# Training process (to be done separately in Python):
# 1. Collect historical internship application data
# 2. Train LSTM model for time-series forecasting
# 3. Export to ONNX using torch.onnx.export()
# 4. Place the .onnx file in this location
#
# Model specifications:
# - Input: Historical demand data (time series)
# - Output: Forecasted demand by sector
# - Helps optimize slot allocation
