# This is a placeholder for the ONNX bias detection model
# In production, this would be a trained fairness model using AIF360
#
# Training process (to be done separately in Python):
# 1. Train logistic regression with fairness constraints
# 2. Use AIF360 library for bias mitigation
# 3. Export to ONNX format
# 4. Place the .onnx file in this location
#
# Model specifications:
# - Input: Allocation distribution by category
# - Output: Bias score (0-1, higher is better)
# - Detects underrepresentation in allocations
