# This is a placeholder for the ONNX embedding model
# In production, this would be a trained BERT/MiniLM model exported from Python
# 
# Training process (to be done separately in Python):
# 1. Fine-tune sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 on job descriptions
# 2. Add domain-specific vocabulary for internships and skills
# 3. Export to ONNX format using torch.onnx.export()
# 4. Place the .onnx file in this location
#
# Model specifications:
# - Input: Tokenized text (max 512 tokens)
# - Output: 384-dimensional embeddings
# - Optimized for semantic similarity in job/skill matching
